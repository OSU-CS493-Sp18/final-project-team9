**Demo due by 5:00pm on Friday 6/15/2018**

Our group chose to build a REST API for a video game review website. The site features both user reviews of video games as well as professional reviews of videogames ...

## 1. Use MongoDB to store user data for your API

Your first task for this assignment is to incorporate a MongoDB database to store information about application users.  At a minimum, each user in this database should have the following information stored:
  * Username (which must be unique)
  * Email address
  * Hashed/salted password
